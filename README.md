🎨 Customization

Update GitHub Contributions

To display your GitHub contributions, edit the Github Graph component located at src/components/sections/About.tsx. Replace the username prop in the GithubGraph component with your GitHub username:
```
<GithubGraph
  username="your-github-username"\\change this line 
  blockMargin={2}
  colorPalette={["#ebedf0", "#a3e2a1", "#72d780", "#47b55d", "#2f8a3e"]}
/>
```

This will fetch and display your GitHub activity. ￼

Customize Content

Modify the content in the src directory to reflect your personal information, projects, and skills. Feel free to add or remove sections as needed to tailor the portfolio to your preferences.

When you’re ready to deploy your portfolio, build the optimized production files with:

```npm run build```

The output will be in the dist directory, ready to be deployed to your hosting platform of choice.
